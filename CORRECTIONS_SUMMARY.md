## ðŸŽ¯ **Key React Version Features Implemented:**

1. **Conditional PDF Upload:** Based on degree selection and result availability
2. **Hall Development Fee:** Always included in calculations
3. **Emergency Processing:** Proper fee calculation for emergency delivery
4. **Hall/College Integration:** Required field with proper API integration
5. **Document Management:** Admit card upload with preview functionality

## ðŸ”„ **Still To Implement (Requires Additional Libraries):**

1. **File Picker Integration:** Need `react-native-document-picker` for PDF selection
2. **PDF Preview:** Need PDF viewer component for preview functionality
3. **Photo Upload:** Need image picker for authorized person photo upload

## ðŸ“± **React Native Specific Considerations:**

- File handling requires native modules (DocumentPicker)
- PDF preview needs PDF viewer library
- Image upload needs ImagePicker library
- Form validation adapted for NativeBase components
- Touch-friendly UI components and spacing

The NewApplicationModal now closely matches the React version's functionality while maintaining React Native best practices and NativeBase design patterns.
